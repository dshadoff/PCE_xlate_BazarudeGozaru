# Test_BRAM

Included are some test BRAMs which were used during the development process; they are mostly named in
an obvious way, describing what they represent.

## BRAM_no_space:
This is a BRAM which has purposely been created to reflect that it is essentially full, and cannot
accommodate additional data from this game (in order to elicit the backup memory error message)

## Before_level_complete:
These were created in order to watch (repeatedly) any end-of-level activity.

## Bazaru_After_Stage_x:
These were created in order to 'skip ahead' a certain amount into the game in order to test the various
graphics related to each of the given levels.
