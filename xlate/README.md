These are the files which assist in the creation of ASCII-art versions of the art
assets in the game.  The translation files are used by the 'pce_gfx' utility, and
map a palette value to an ASCII character for contrast.

The use of ASCII art was an idea I had, as I am not comfortable with normal art
programs (or art in general), but am comfortable with text editors.


Example ASCII characters used for contrast:
Dark characters:   # *
Medium characters: : | ~
Light characters:  , .
