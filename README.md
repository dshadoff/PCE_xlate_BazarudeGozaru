Translation patch development area for PC Engine game Bazaru de Gozaru

Bazaru de Gozaru was a game released on the PC Engine console, in Super CDROM format.
It features a monkey, who needs to be guided by the player through various puzzles.

The items for translation in this game are primarily icons and signs, rather than text.
As such, it is more suited to a person with some level of artistic skill.

I started this translation in roughly May of 2005, creating some rudimentary tools
because graphic utilities at that time were not careful to respect palettes.
